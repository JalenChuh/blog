对与许多判断，你可能是依靠着你的下意识，但你自己却不之情

<!--more-->

As part of an experiment to explore the human mind  
we asked twenty-two people 
to solve the same riddle and recomed their responses

Are you ready?

The riddle:

A father is about to bring his son   
to a job interview applying 
for a position at a large stockbrokers company 

Just as they arrive at the company's parking lot.
the sons phone rings.

He looks at his father who say:"Go ahead, answer it"

The caller it's the trading oommpenty's CEO who says.
Good luck son, your've got this

The son ends the call and once again looks at his father,
who is still next to him in their car

How is this possible?

一位父亲准备带他的儿子去面试
争取一个大型股票经纪公司的职位

正当他们的车进入公司停车场的时候  
儿子的手机响了  

转头看向了坐在驾驶位的父亲  
父亲一脸奇怪，说：“你接啊。”  

儿子接了起来，打电话的人是一个贸易公司的 CEO 
说：“儿子(son)，祝你好运，你一定可以的。”  

儿子挂断电话，再次转头看向了坐在他身旁的父亲。

那么这是怎么回事呢？？？
